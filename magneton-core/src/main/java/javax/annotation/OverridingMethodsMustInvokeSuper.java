/**
 * Indicates that any concrete method that overrides the annotated method, directly or
 * indirectly, must invoke {@code super.theAnnotatedMethod(...)} at some point. This does
 * not necessarily require an <i>unconditional</i> call; any matching call appearing
 * directly within the method body (not inside an intervening class or lambda expression)
 * is acceptable.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the overriding method is itself overridable, applying this annotation to that method
 * is technically redundant, but may be helpful to readers.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Preferred:</b> usually, a better solution is to make the method {@code final}, and
 * have its implementation delegate to a second concrete method which <i>is</i>
 * overridable (or to a function object which subclasses can specify). "Mandatory"
 * statements remain in the final method while "optional" code moves out. This is the only
 * way to make sure the statements will be executed unconditionally.
